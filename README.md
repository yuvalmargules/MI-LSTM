# MI-LSTM
Deep Learning project for predicting close stock prices using MI-LSTM
MI-LSTM is an LSTM based model which takes into consideration stocks from positive correlated companies, negative correlated companies, and the index it belongs to.
In order to calculate those variables within the LSTM cell, we use Attention Mechanism with learning weights of which we can trace the weights during the process and get insights about the market's status.
